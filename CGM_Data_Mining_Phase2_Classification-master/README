Steps to test an input file for meal or no meal prediction
a) Place the file to be predicted as meal and no meal in the same folder as a .csv file
b) Open and load all the submitted files in MATLAB
c) In the command window execute the function file PredictMealOrNoMeal.m by writing PredictMealOrNoMeal('inputfilename.csv');
d) This will create an output.csv which will contain all the class labels from the four models.

Steps to generate models from the training data
a) Open and load all the submitted files along with the given meal and no meal data (which is not included in submission) in MATLAB.
b) Run the takesTrainingDataAndGeneratesModel.m file to generate the models.
c) This generates four .mat files which are the trained models along with EigenVectorsTop5.csv which is required as an input to predict meal and no meal data.
